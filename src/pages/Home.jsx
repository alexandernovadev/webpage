          Thanks for viewing my portfolio ðŸ›¸, my path in programming begins when
          I see Java code for the first time ðŸ“”, by the way I don't like Java, I
          hate Jframe hahahaha ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢, after a long journey I understand the
          basics of programming logic, and In 2013 I ventured to create web
          pages with bootstrap, and some animations with js ðŸ‘“. My desire for
          knowledge led me to be self-taught and learn PHP and Mysql.

          Thanks to youtube and many tutorials I managed to create my first app
          with codeIgniter, with a lot of spaghetti code ðŸ˜± but it is honest
          work as the meme says, after that app many more would come with
          Laravel. Learning many good programming practices ðŸŽ“. I decide to give
          it a try Look at AngularJS, after taking many Angular courses from
          Fernando Herrera on Udemy ðŸ’¼.

          Going back to React and Node, I am contacted by a startup, where I
          start working with several new tools ðŸ—¡ðŸ”¨, one of them Docker, and
          improving AWS skills with s3, rds, etc. In each company there is
          always something new to learn and in this case learning flutter and
          how to upload an app to the stores was the best. See how flutter
          improved the performance of the app.

          When I feel fullstack power ðŸŽ“ðŸ“…ðŸ“„, that's when I decide to look for a
          job. what started as a hobby could feed me ðŸ’°, I joined my first
          company where they taught me the basics of SEO and a lot of ReactJS,
          redux, advanced JSX.SQL, NodeJS. By this time I didn't want to go back
          to PHP anymore, I had found a love for javascript.ðŸ“ˆ
